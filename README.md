# Mod_11_Scrape
Module 11 HW: 2 Deliverables

## mars_news_scrape 
This notebook scrapes from an example news webpage. The output for this part is a JSON file called article_lod in the Output folder.

## mars_temp_scrape
This notebook pulls data from an example webpage illustrating weather data on Mars gathered by the Curiosity rover. The table is exported as a CSV called mars_temperature_data in the Output folder. The second half of the notebook goes over datacasting, attribute analysis, and the creation of some bar plots. An additional CSV has been created to illustrate the addition of the day counter spanning the start and end dates of the scraped data set.

## Extra folder
This folder contains the erroneous version of my mars_news_scrape. The primary differentiation between the two is that the graded version uses a list of dictionaries, whereas the Extra version compiles a dictionary of lists. Similarly, though, there is an output JSON called article_dol. BeautifulSoup portions are nigh identical.
